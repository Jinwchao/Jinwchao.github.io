    "text": "As the Earth’s temperature slowly rises, we are not only facing disappearing glaciers, rising sea levels and an increase in extreme weather events - our food security is also being threatened as never before. The impacts of global warming on agriculture are far-reaching and complex, and from shifts in planting seasons to adjustments in crop growth cycles, climate change is rewriting the global food production map.\nBut this story is not a one-dimensional pessimistic narrative. It is a story of challenge, opportunityand innovation. It involves scientists, farmers, policymakers and ordinary citizens, each working to address this global challenge. Through three interactive charts - showing changes in global temperature trends, population growth, and food production - we’ll take you on a deep dive into how global warming is affecting our “breadbasket,” and what we can do about it."

This narrative is woven from data, scientific research, and the lived experiences of farmers, scientists, and communities worldwide. By presenting interactive charts on global temperature trends, population growth, and food production, I invite you to see these changes through my data—the challenges, opportunities, and innovations.\n\n\nWhy This Matters to Me, and Why It Should Matter to You\nThis exploration is more than just an academic endeavor; it’s a personal quest for understanding and action. In the climate crisis, the resilience of our global food supply demonstrates human ingenuity and calls for action to adopt sustainable practices and policies, ensuring food security for future generations.\n\n\nJoin us\nWe invite you to join us in protecting the environment, one way or another. Every contribution you make will have a significant impact on the planet, working together for global food security."

    "text": "Global Temperature Trends\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), global climate change has both indirect and direct impacts on agrifood systems. Changes in rainfall patterns, the increased frequency of extreme weather events and phenomena such as ocean acidification directly threaten global food production and security. These changes are forcing agricultural producers to adapt to new environmental conditions, which often requires time and resources, and in some cases a complete reconfiguration of existing agricultural technologies and methods.\n \nThe first graphic shows the effects of temperature trends on a global scale.\nWith the horizontal axis, we follow the time from in the 20th century to the present day. The vertical axis, on the other hand, presents us with a reality that can’t be ignored - rising average global temperatures. And the drop-down bar next to the chart, which allows us to select different countries, reveals a key truth: Global warming is a global problem, it affects different countries to different degrees.\nThis graph is a look back at the history of climate change over the past few centuries, but also a foretaste of what is to come. By looking at these temperature trends, we can begin to understand the impact that global warming may have on our “breadbasket” - global food production."

    "text": "Increasing world population\nIn the current study, Impacts of land use, population, and climate change on global food security, it is projected that the global population will peak at 9.7 billion in 2050, accompanied by a significant increase in demand for food. This population growth will inevitably put enormous pressure on the global food supply system. At the same time, frequent and extreme weather events triggered by climate change are eroding the stability and predictability of agricultural production. Together, these factors constitute a major challenge to achieving food security on a global scale.\n \nThis interactive world map reveals to us the dynamics of population growth and population density over time on a global scale.\nOn the map’s timeline, we traverse historical points marked every ten years from 1970 to 2020. At the same time, the map visually shows us the size and density of the population in each country/region in a given year by changing the size and color of the circles. By exploring this map, we not only gain a deeper understanding of the demographic changes of the past half-century, but also anticipate the challenges we may face in the future."

This is a story of opportunity, which suggests that advances in agricultural technology, improved crop varieties and better farming practices are playing a key role in offsetting the negative impact of global warming on crop yields. Moreover, the joint efforts of the global agricultural community to adapt to changing climatic conditions demonstrate the potential for innovation and cooperation in addressing this global challenge."
