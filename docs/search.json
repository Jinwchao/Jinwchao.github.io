    "text": "As the Earth’s temperature slowly rises, we are not only facing disappearing glaciers, rising sea levels and an increase in extreme weather events - our food security is also being threatened as never before. The impacts of global warming on agriculture are far-reaching and complex, and from shifts in planting seasons to adjustments in crop growth cycles, climate change is rewriting the global food production map.\nBut this story is not a one-dimensional pessimistic narrative. It is a story of challenge and opportunity, crisis and innovation. It involves scientists, farmers, policymakers and ordinary citizens, each working to address this global challenge. Through three interactive charts - showing changes in global temperature trends, population growth, and food production - we’ll take you on a deep dive into how global warming is affecting our “breadbasket,” and what we can do about it. “and what we can do to protect and sustain our food supply chain."
