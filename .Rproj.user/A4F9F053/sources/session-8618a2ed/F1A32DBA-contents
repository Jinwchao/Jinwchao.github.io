As the Earth's temperature slowly rises, we are not only facing disappearing glaciers, rising sea levels and an increase in extreme weather events - our food security is also being threatened as never before. The impacts of global warming on agriculture are far-reaching and complex, and from shifts in planting seasons to adjustments in crop growth cycles, climate change is rewriting the global food production map.

But this story is not a one-dimensional pessimistic narrative. It is a story of challenge, opportunityand innovation. It involves scientists, farmers, policymakers and ordinary citizens, each working to address this global challenge. Through three interactive charts - showing changes in global temperature trends, population growth, and food production - we'll take you on a deep dive into how global warming is affecting our "breadbasket," and what we can do about it.

## Global Temperature Trends

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), global climate change has both indirect and direct impacts on agrifood systems. Changes in rainfall patterns, the increased frequency of extreme weather events and phenomena such as ocean acidification directly threaten global food production and security. These changes are forcing agricultural producers to adapt to new environmental conditions, which often requires time and resources, and in some cases a complete reconfiguration of existing agricultural technologies and methods.

The first graphic shows the effects of temperature trends on a global scale.

With the horizontal axis, we follow the march of time from the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century to the present day. The vertical axis, on the other hand, presents us with a reality that can't be ignored - rising average global temperatures. And the drop-down bar next to the chart, which allows us to select different countries, reveals a key truth: Global warming is a global problem, it affects different countries to different degrees.

This graph is a look back at the history of climate change over the past few centuries, but also a foretaste of what is to come. By looking at these temperature trends, we can begin to understand the impact that global warming may have on our "breadbasket" - global food production.

## Increasing world population

In the current study, Impacts of land use, population, and climate change on global food security, it is projected that the global population will peak at 9.7 billion in 2050, accompanied by a significant increase in demand for food. This population growth will inevitably put enormous pressure on the global food supply system. At the same time, frequent and extreme weather events triggered by climate change are eroding the stability and predictability of agricultural production. Together, these factors constitute a major challenge to achieving food security on a global scale.

This interactive world map reveals to us the dynamics of population growth and population density over time on a global scale.

On the map's timeline, we traverse historical points marked every ten years from 1970 to 2020. At the same time, the map visually shows us the size and density of the population in each country/region in a given year by changing the size and color of the circles. By exploring this map, we not only gain a deeper understanding of the demographic changes of the past half-century, but also anticipate the challenges we may face in the future.

## Crop population over world

Agricultural production systems not only have to overcome the challenges posed by climate change, such as extreme weather events, water scarcity and changes in pests and diseases, but also have to scale up production to meet the demands of a growing

However, recent statistics show a slight increase in global food production. This is a story of opportunity, which suggests that advances in agricultural technology, improved crop varieties and better farming practices are playing a key role in offsetting the negative impact of global warming on crop yields. Moreover, the joint efforts of the global agricultural community to adapt to changing climatic conditions demonstrate the potential for innovation and cooperation in addressing this global challenge.
